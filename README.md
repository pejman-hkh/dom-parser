# dom-parser
Fast php DOM parser

in this project i haven't used Regex, I just parsed with pure php

Yet I'm working on it

Now we can find in html with class and id and attributes
```
$p->find();
$p->find(".test");
$p->find("#test");
$p->find("input[type=button]");
```

I wrote somethings like next,prev,text,... that i'll complete it at the future
